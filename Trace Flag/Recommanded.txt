-T1117		Causes files in a filegroup to grow at the same time. Most often used for tempdb, but affects all databases.
-T1118		Removes the use of mixed extents. Most often used to help with tempdb contention.
-T1204		Returns resources involved with a deadlock.
-T1222		Returns resources involved with a deadlock in XML format.
-T2371		Lowers the threshold for automatic statistics updates to occur based on table size. Good for VLDBs.
-T2467		CPU scheduling â€“ place threads on the least loaded node.
-T3605		Used alongside 1204 and 1222 to send deadlock information to the error log.
-T3895		Memory-Optimized TempDB Metadata, Undocumented trace flag
-T9567	    Enables compression of the data stream for Availability Groups during automatic seeding
-T610		Minimal Logg generation for bulk insert
-T460		Replace error message ID 8152 with message ID 2628 (String or binary data would be truncated. The statement has been terminated.).
